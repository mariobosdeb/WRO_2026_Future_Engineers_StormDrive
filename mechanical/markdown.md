# 🛠️ Mechanical Components

This folder contains the official 3D design and manufacturing files for the StormDrive autonomous vehicle.

### 📐 Chassis Information
Our mechanical platform is based on the open-source **WRO Future Engineers Chassis (Thing: 6667669)**. We adapted and organized the physical mounting points to perfectly fit our Arduino Uno, L298N motor driver, and custom 18650 battery holder.

### 📷 Camera Mounting
Instead of using a separate 3D printed mount, the **DFRobot HuskyLens AI camera** is attached directly to the integrated front bumper (`RCcar_7.stl`). This minimizes weight and improves structural rigidity during impacts.

### 📂 3D Print Files Directory (STL)
The vehicle chassis components are split into 8 modular parts, mapped exactly to the official project blueprint:
* `RCcar_1.stl` - Front Lower Suspensions
* `RCcar_2.stl` - Main Chassis Base Platform
* `RCcar_3.stl` - Rear Axle & Motor Holders
* `RCcar_4.stl` - Steering Blocks & Ackermann Links
* `RCcar_5.stl` - Front Upper Suspension & Mounts
* `RCcar_6.stl` - Electronics Mounting Plate
* `RCcar_7.stl` - Front Bumper / Impact Protector
* `RCcar_8.stl` - Transmission Gears & Spacers
